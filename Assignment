INTRODUCTION

From this assignment I learn how to apply for loop , while loop and if statement to complete my assignment. 
This assignment is making a car loan calculator to compute the amount of monthly repayment and generate principal , interest and balance loan repayment table, by year . 
Before we start coding ,we had to make a clear pseudocode and flow chart, so  it can make our work easier. By using while loop, I can limit the input and keep looping until me or someone enter the proper amount for calculate the monthly repayment. 
We just have to enter the car price , down payment amount , car loan period and loan interest rate , and then you can easily get the monthly repayment and the whole repayment table.
